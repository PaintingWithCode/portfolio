A website to help voters identify their ideal candidate in the 2016 Presidental Elections.

The objective was to offer a platform that would serve as an objective reference point for millenials and first time voters looking to make sense of an area usually filled with clutter and bias.

A solo project in terms of design and development, but with some gracious help from friends in sourcing and reviewing the content.
