A turn-based multiplayer browser game inspired by Munchkins and Dungeons & Dragons.

It included a custom content creation feature where users could design and submit their own takes

The culmination of a year long senior capstone project at NYU Tandon, Corridor was designed and
developed by a team of 5 students.
